            <p>As per the 8th century BCE Rigvedic text Aitareya Brahmana, the Andhras left North India off the banks of the Yamuna river and migrated to South India. The first major Andhra polity was the Satavahana dynasty (2nd century BCE–2nd century CE) which ruled over the entire Deccan plateau and even distant areas of western and central India. They established trade relations with the Roman Empire. After that, the major rulers included the Vishnukundinas, Eastern Chalukyas, Vijayanagara Empire, Nizam dynasty, and the British Raj..</p></br>

            <h2>LEGISLATURE</h2></br>
            <p>In the 2024 assembly elections, TDP-led National Democratic Alliance with Jana Sena Party and Bharatiya Janata Party emerged victorious defeating the incumbent YSRCP led by Jagan. It won 164 seats, while YSRCP got 11, a big drop from 151 it held. N. Chandrababu Naidu became the chief minister of the state for the fourth time.[180] According to an opinion, several factors including the prevailing anti-incumbency against the previous government and the alliance's promise of "Welfare with Wealth Generation" contributed to the success of TDP-led alliance.Andhra Pradesh comprises two regions, namely Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema. The northern part of Coastal Andhra is sometimes mentioned separately as North Andhra, particularly after the bifurcation to raise voice against underdevelopment.</p>
